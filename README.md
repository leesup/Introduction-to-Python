# Introduction to Python

Hello, 

My colleagues ([Emily Yaklich](https://github.com/emilyyaklich) and [Robyn Stix](https://github.com/rstix287) and I have co-developed and co-instructed a series of Introduction to Python courses. We designed these courses for those who have little to no experience working in Python. Our goal was to cover basic Python syntax as well as useful scientific applications.

We are sharing Jupyter Notebooks we used for our courses divided into two parts.

[The first Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/leesup/Introduction-to-Python/blob/master/JupyterNotebooks/intro_python_1.ipynb) covers:
  1. Commenting
  2. Identation
  3. Assigning a Variable
  4. Types
  5. Data Structures
  6. Functions

[The second Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/leesup/Introduction-to-Python/blob/master/JupyterNotebooks/intro_python_2.ipynb) covers:
  1. Conditional Logic Statements
  2. Loops
  3. File Input and Output
  4. NumPy
  5. Pandas
  6. Matplotlib

We recommend you to spend about an hour (or more) for each Notebook to fully understand the basic concepts of Python. A firm understanding in these basic concepts will serve as a strong foundation in learning Python. Although this is not all you need to use Python, we truly hope this will be your starting point to fall in love with Python.

Enjoy!
